# An AWS Lambda Function to send a POST request to SendGrid

```js
npm install
```

You will need to add your verified address in `index.js` and create an environment variable in the lambda function for your SendGrid key.

When creating creating the zip folder to upload to the lambda, don't include the parent folder and be sure to include the `node_modules` folder.
